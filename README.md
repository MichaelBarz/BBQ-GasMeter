# BBQ GasMeter
This Android app is a simple visualization of a weight scale sensor (HX711) based on Arduino and connected via Bluetooth (HC-06). It shows the remaining amount of gas for gas-based BBQs. For this, the gas container is placed on a modified bathroom scale from Amazon (~15â‚¬) and the weight is used as indicator for the remaining amount of gas. Only the maximum filling of the bottle (grams) and the weight of the empty bottle needs to be set.
